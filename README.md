## About Me

I’ve used bespoke software to develop seismic imaging solutions throughout my career but have always been just as fascinated by how these technologies work under the hood.

My passion is problem solving, and I’ve never been afraid to look in any direction to find the best solution. The area of geophysics I have worked in is applied science - the tools used to image the sub-surface are software and high-performance computing. So if there’s a need to better visualise the data or optimise the workflow I’m just as keen to throw myself into learning a new programming language or building a web app as I am to experiment with the latest geophysical techniques.
